Used sales data from Project 1 to be distributed to Projects 2 & 3 for analysis. 

Project 1 is in code format.
Projects 2 & 3 are in .pdf and .ipynb format.

Files with extension .ipynb are just Jupyter notebooks with no output. (Had errors uploading .ipynb with output)
Files with extension .pdf show output following its code.
